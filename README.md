# ESP32_WhatsApp

# Overview
This application sends a message via WhatsApp when combustible gas concentration in the air is too high. 
Combustible gas concentration in the air is measured by the MQ 9 sensor and sent to the ESP32 Devkit V1 board.
The MQ 9 sensor is powered by 5V DC from the Arduino Nano board.
